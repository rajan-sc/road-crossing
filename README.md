# Road Crossing Game Project

The Turtle Crossing game involves a turtle (controlled by the player) trying to cross a busy multi-lane highway filled with randomly generated cars. The goal is to reach the other side without getting hit by a car.

### Gameplay

- **Player Control**: The player controls the turtle, which can only move forwards.
- **Random Cars**: Cars move horizontally across the screen, randomly generated at different speeds and lanes.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: Each time the turtle reaches the other side, the cars speed up, and the turtle goes back to the starting position to cross again.
- **Game Over**: If the turtle collides with a car, the game ends.

## Features

- **Turtle Movement**: Control the turtle to move forwards.
- **Random Car Generation**: Cars appear at random intervals and move across the screen.
- **Collision Detection**: Detect collisions between the turtle and cars.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: Cars increase in speed as the player progresses.
- **Game Over Condition**: End the game when the turtle collides with a car.

## Getting Started

- Creating and inheriting classes
